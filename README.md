# DiscoTech - Terraform meetup #

Welcome to the lab part of this meetup [Let's Meetup and script things](https://www.meetup.com/DiscoTech-By-Oracle/events/252266605/ "Let's Meetup and script things")

## Introduction	##

The labs are in tutorial form to help you learn and get an understanding of how Terraform works in controlling a cloud environment, in this case the Oracle OCI Cloud environment but it is basically the same for Amazon, Google, Microsoft etc.

To get going you need to do some setup tasks.

1. Install Terraform on your machine
2. Install some form of bash on your machine
3. Copy the demo and environment files and setup your Terraform working directory
4. Get the Credentials for an instance in the Oracle Cloud (provided at the meetup)
5. Create the public/private keys required to access the Oracle Cloud
6. Test the Terraform sample scripts

## Copy the demo and environment files and setup your Terraform working directory ##
Download and unpack the demo and environment files from here (terraform-meetup/single_and_demo.tgz)
